I am a Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [Prof. R. Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/){:target="_blank"}.

I graduated with a dual degree (Bachelor's and Master's) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, majoring in [Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering](http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} and minoring in [Computer Science](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2021.

I spent the Fall of 2023 working at <span style="color:#ff0000">**Google Research**</span> on an “AI for Social Good” project, where I studied the use of data-driven approaches to efficiently allocate scarce resources and encourage patients to seek healthcare in rural India. I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe){:target="_blank"} and collaborated closely with his team at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. The project involved designing sequential decision-making policies using the Restless Multi-armed Bandit framework.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](files/CV_SAPTARSHI.pdf).

### Research Interests
I have broad interests in the **theoretical understanding of machine learning**. Currently, I am exploring **knowledge distillation** from a theoretical perspective, particularly using the techniques of the **neural tangent kernel**. I am also interested in sequential decision-making problems, including **restless bandits**, **slicing in modern communication networks**, **scheduling in sensor networks**, etc.
