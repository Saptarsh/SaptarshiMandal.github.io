### Research Interests
I have broad interests in the **theoretical understanding of machine learning**. Currently, I am exploring **knowledge distillation** from a theoretical perspective, particularly using the techniques of the **neural tangent kernel**. I am also interested in sequential decision-making problems, including **restless bandits**, **slicing in modern communication networks**, **scheduling in sensor networks**, etc.
