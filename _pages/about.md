I am a third year Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [Mark A. Anastasio]([http://www.billfefferman.com](https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/)){:target="_blank"}.  I also closely work with [Center for Label-free Imaging] (https://climb.beckman.illinois.edu/)

Previously, from 2018 to 2020, I was a Master's student at the University of Waterloo, under the brilliant supervision of [Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan](https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/profile/vengu){:target="_blank"} and [John Zelek](http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~jzelek/).  

I was an undergraduate at [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in){:target="_blank"}, India in the Department of Electrical Engineering, from 2014 to 2018.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](files/CV_Sourya.pdf).

### Research Interests 


I have broad interests in solving **Medical Imaging** problems using advanced computational methods. Specific topics that I am interested in include **image-to-image translation problems in medical imaging**, **interpretable deep learning**, and **label-free imaging**. I am also interested in **AI in healthcare**, in general.

### Outreach

I am a part of ["bigyan"](https://bigyan.org.in){:target="_blank"}, a science outreach group that aims to popularize science in the Bengali language. Please feel free to message me on any social media platform or send me an email if you are interested in contributing to "bigyan" or discussing science outreach more generally.
